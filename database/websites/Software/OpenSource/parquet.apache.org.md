## What is parquet.apache.org about?
Parquet is an open-source file format available through the Apache Software Foundation designed to support very efficient compression and encoding schemes. It is optimized for use with complex data in large-scale processing frameworks and data processing systems like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and other big data processing tools. Parquet is particularly good at handling nested data structures and enables users to read, write, and process data efficiently by allowing them to read only the parts of the data that are needed for the current task, reducing I/O overhead.

The format is built to support very efficient columnar data storage, which means that data is stored by column rather than by row. This approach enables better compression, which saves storage space and allows for faster query execution as only the necessary columns are read from the disk. Parquet supports advanced nested data structures, and it uses the record shredding and assembly algorithm described in the Dremel paper published by Google.

Apache Parquet works well with complex data types and is also highly compatible with different programming languages through the use of APIs. It has become a choice of many organizations for its performance benefits and compatibility with big data tools. It plays a key role in the Hadoop ecosystem but also integrates well with other cloud-based data services. With its strong backing by the Apache Software Foundation, Parquet continues to evolve and receive community-driven enhancements making it a reliable and powerful format for modern data storage and analysis needs.

# Test Criteria IOT

> This document is unfinished. Help adding criteria
{.is-warning}

The test criteria for IOT (Internet Of Things) is usually a bit lower than a full featured OS. IOT devices often have limited hardware specs and thus it's hard to fulfil every IPv6 dream.

| criteria | importance | description |
| - | - | - |
| Stateless config | must have | |
| Stateful config | must have | | 
| static IPv6 configuration | must have | |
| IPv6 only | nice to have | IPv6 only networks are quite rare nowadays. As they get more popular the need for this rises |

Todo: check RFC 4191, 4291, 4443, 4861, 4862, 5095, 6980, 7217, 8106, 8200, 8201

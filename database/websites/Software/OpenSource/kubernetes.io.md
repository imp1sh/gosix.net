| Domainname | kubernetes.io
| Category | OpenSource |
| IPv6 ranking | nonexistent :x: [ðŸ”—](/howto/ranking) |
| Explanation | The domain doesn't even have an AAAA record to begin with. The is the worst ranking a webite can get in the IPv6 database. |
| Amount of AAAA records for domain | 0 |
| ICMPv6 success rate | 0%|
| HTTP success rate | 0% |
| HTTPS success rate | 0% |

## What is kubernetes.io about?
Kubernetes, often referred to as "k8s," is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Developed originally by Google but now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Kubernetes has fast become the cornerstone of cloud-native development strategies. It provides a framework for running distributed systems resiliently, allowing for scaling and failover for your applications, and provides deployment patterns and more.

Kubernetes abstracts away the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure, making the deployment of applications on a cluster of computers appear as if they were operating on a single machine. This abstraction enables portability across different providers of infrastructure, be it public clouds like AWS, Azure, and GCP, private clouds, or on-premises installations. Since its introduction, Kubernetes has garnered a massive community of contributors and users, and has influenced a rich ecosystem of tools and services designed to work with it, enhancing its capabilities and making it more accessible.

The platform's features include service discovery and load balancing, storage orchestration, automated rollouts and rollbacks, self-healing (automatically replacing and rescheduling failed containers), secret and configuration management, and more. As a CNCF-hosted project, Kubernetes embraces the ethos of open collaboration and community-driven development, ensuring it stays at the forefront of container orchestration technology.

Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently between C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, and OCaml.

## What is thrift.apache.org about?
Thrift is an open-source software framework for scalable cross-language services development. It was originally developed at Facebook and later on became a part of the Apache Software Foundation. Apache Thrift allows developers to define data types and service interfaces in a simple definition file, which can then be used to generate code for any of the supported languages, making it easier to create services that work efficiently between multiple programming languages.

With its robust and language-agnostic interface definition language (IDL), Apache Thrift is particularly well-suited for building performant, scalable backend services. It supports a variety of programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa, JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml, and Delphi. This makes it an ideal choice for systems that require a high degree of interoperability between various languages.

Apache Thrift encapsulates and abstracts the details of the network communication, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than the intricacies of network protocols. By promoting code reuse and consistency, it reduces both development time and potential for errors. Thrift's binary communication protocol is also designed for efficiency, minimizing overhead and providing faster data serialization compared to text-based formats like JSON or XML, which is particularly beneficial in bandwidth-sensitive applications.

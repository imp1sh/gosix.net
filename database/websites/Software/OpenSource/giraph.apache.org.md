## What is giraph.apache.org about?
Giraph is an open-source project by the Apache Software Foundation designed to perform large-scale graph processing. It is an iterative graph processing system built for high scalability. Primarily, Giraph is used for running large-scale graph algorithms, such as those commonly found in social network analysis, machine learning, and network optimization. It is engineered on top of the Apache Hadoop ecosystem and uses the MapReduce framework for processing graphs but has been optimized for vertex-centric computing.

Giraph allows for the processing of graphs with billions of nodes and edges by utilizing a distributed computing environment. It is based on the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) compute model, which involves a series of supersteps during which messages are passed between nodes to perform computations. In each superstep, each vertex can receive messages sent during the previous superstep, perform computations, and send messages that will be received by other vertices in the next superstep.

Given its robust scalability, Giraph is a powerful tool for organizations dealing with massive graph datasets. Its architecture is inspired by Google's Pregel, and it provides a simple and efficient API for graph algorithms' developers. Giraph integrates flawlessly with Hadoop and leverages its file system (HDFS) for large-scale data storage and its MapReduce engine for scheduling and fault-tolerance, making graph data processing reliable and accessible across large clusters of commodity hardware.

I apologize, but as of my knowledge cutoff date in April 2023, I do not have real-time internet access or the ability to browse external websites including www.peugeot.fr.

The site also typically features sections for after-sales services, such as maintenance and repair services, parts and accessories, and warranties. Peugeot aims to provide an engaging and user-friendly experience, with multimedia content such as images, videos, and interactive configurators that help visitors visualize their potential new vehicle. The website is also a hub for company news, promotions, and financing options, bridging the gap between the iconic French automaker and its consumer base in France.

## What is bookkeeper.apache.org about?
Apache BookKeeper, a project managed by the Apache Software Foundation, is a scalable, fault-tolerant, and low-latency storage service optimized for real-time workloads and write-heavy applications. It provides robust and durable storage of streams of records, which is a critical requirement for distributed systems to ensure data consistency and reliability.

At its core, BookKeeper is designed to work in the environment where there are a high number of concurrent writes and reads. It uses an ensemble of multiple bookies (storage servers) to store log entries, which are replicated to ensure redundancy and resilience in case of failures. What sets BookKeeper apart is its unique ledger abstraction, which isolates writes from reads, enabling high throughput and consistent performance.

Furthermore, Apache BookKeeper supports strong consistency guarantees, making it suitable for various applications that cannot afford to lose data such as message queues, stream processing, and ledger systems. Its architecture is expandable and integrates seamlessly with other Apache projects like Pulsar and Heron, providing a complete solution for managing data streams within distributed environments. As an open-source project, it benefits from a vibrant community that continually contributes to its development and maintenance, ensuring that it stays relevant and upto-date with the latest advancements in technology.

# gosix.net
gosix.net IPv6 compatibility database content

This git repository is two things:

1. A second backend for the [IPv6 compatibility database](https://gosix.net) website.
1. A second method for users to contribute to the [IPv6 compatibility database](https://gosix.net) website.

If you think the content needs an upate or if you think there should be more content.

1. Fork that repo
1. Edit
1. Make a Pull Request

I will be happy to review it and merge it into the git repo and by that: to the website.

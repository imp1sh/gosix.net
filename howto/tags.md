# Tags

Tags are very important for the functionality of gosix.net. Using tags you can filter by category and by IPv6 compatibility status.

Do not create new tags, only use those defined on this page. Tags are always singular never plural. Don't assign manufacturer names as tags or the name of the software / product / container.

## Category tags
Currently there are those category tags available:

- [x] container
- [x] datacenter
- [x] device
- [x] authdns (authoritative DNS Servers)
- [x] game
- [x] iot
- [x] isp 
- [x] os
- [x] software
- [x] website
{.grid-list}

Every review can only have one of those tags.

## Ranking tags
Ranking tags flag the IPv6 compatibility status. More details [here](/howto/ranking).
- :1st_place_medal: rank1
- :2nd_place_medal: rank2
- :3rd_place_medal: rank3
- :arrow_down: flawed
- :arrow_double_down: problematic
- :x: nonexistant
- :wastebasket: totalfailure
{.grid-list}

Every review can only have one of those tag, except the `totalfailure` tag can be assigned additionally.

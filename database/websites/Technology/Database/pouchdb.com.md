## What is pouchdb.com about?
PouchDB is an open-source JavaScript database inspired by Apache CouchDB that is designed to run well within the browser. It enables applications to store data locally while offline and then synchronize it with CouchDB and compatible servers when the application is back online, thus providing a seamless, responsive experience to users, even when they're offline.

One of the core features of PouchDB is its ability to work on practically any platform that uses a web browser, whether it's a desktop, a smartphone, or even a smartwatch, as long as it supports JavaScript. Furthermore, its API is designed to be easy to learn and use, mimicking the CouchDB API with a promise-based interface.

PouchDB implements a high-level replication protocol and has a powerful plugin system. This replication is able to handle bi-directional data sync making it suitable for real-time applications, and its plugin system allows developers to extend its capabilities in various ways. It also supports MapReduce-based querying for fast retrieval of stored data. As part of the Apache Software Foundation, PouchDB represents a commitment to robust, community-driven, and open-source technology.

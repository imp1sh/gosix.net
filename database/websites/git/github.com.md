## What is github.com about?
GitHub, Inc. is the company behind GitHub.com, the world's leading software development platform that fundamentally changed the way developers store, manage, and collaborate on code. At the heart of GitHub is Git, a distributed version control system built by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development. GitHub simplifies the use of Git and amplifies its capabilities by providing a user-friendly web interface, along with features such as fork, pull request, and mergeâ€”facilitating social coding by enabling multiple developers to work on the same project without direct conflict.

Launched in 2008, GitHub became a crucial tool for both individual programmers and organizations by promoting open-source collaboration and communication. It supports a range of programming languages and hosts a myriad of projects, from small personal repositories to large-scale enterprise applications. The platform offers issue tracking, code review, continuous integration, and other features that enhance productivity and code quality. It also acts as a social network for developers, allowing them to follow each other's work, contribute to projects, and showcase their portfolio.

GitHub's impact on the development community is enormous, offering a repository for coding knowledge and resources while fostering a culture of shared innovation. With millions of users and repositories, GitHub remains at the forefront of shaping how software is built in the modern era. It supports open-source projects, provides private repository options for proprietary work, and has become an invaluable tool for developers around the world.

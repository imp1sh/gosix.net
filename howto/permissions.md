# Permissions

There are different user groups, i.e.

## New users
When a new user registers they automatically become a member of the `New Users` group. This grants them the ability to add comments.

## Moderators
Moderators have the same permissions as [contributors](/howto/permissions#contributors) but on top they can
- delete pages
- rename / move pages

## Administrators
Administrators have all privileges there are. Currently it's not intended for a user to become an Administrator.

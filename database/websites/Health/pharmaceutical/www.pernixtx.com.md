## What is www.pernixtx.com about?
Pernix Therapeutics Holdings, operating through the website www.pernixtx.com, was a specialty pharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the acquisition, development, and commercialization of prescription drugs, especially within the areas of pain, neurology, and sleep management. The company aimed to advance and provide healthcare solutions by improving existing medications or developing innovative products which address significant medical needs.

Pernix's business model usually revolved around revitalizing older products by improving their efficacy or reducing side effects, as well as marketing and selling under-promoted products from other pharmaceutical companies. They often targeted niche markets and patient groups that were under-served by the broader pharmaceutical industry. Their strategic approach was to leverage their commercial infrastructure and expertise in drug development to offer better therapeutic options for patients and healthcare providers.

It should be noted that Pernix Therapeutics filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations in 2019, and as such, the information regarding their website and its content might no longer be current. Consequently, the website may not be functional or provide accurate and up-to-date information about the company's operations.

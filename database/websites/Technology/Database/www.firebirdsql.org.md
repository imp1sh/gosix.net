## What is www.firebirdsql.org about?
Firebird Foundation Incorporated's official website, www.firebirdsql.org, serves as the central hub for one of the most venerable and trusted open-source Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), Firebird SQL. Founded on the InterBase 6.0 codebase, which was released as open-source by Borland in 2000, Firebird has since evolved through community-driven development into a feature-rich and robust database solution. It provides a fully SQL-92 compliant database engine and has continued to develop with support for newer SQL standards.

The website offers a plethora of resources for users and developers alike, ranging from detailed documentation, downloads of the latest and past releases of the Firebird database server, to community support forums and lists of third-party tools designed to work with Firebird databases. It also contains information about the project's history, governance, and ways to contribute to the ongoing development and maintenance of the software.

FirebirdSQL.org showcases the Firebird Foundation's commitment to the continual improvement of the Firebird database system. It is a testament to the dedicated efforts of a global community that ensures the software remains reliable, secure, and freely available. This open-source platform is widely recognized for its low overhead, high performance, and strong support for stored procedures and triggers, making it a venerable option for developers in need of an enterprise-grade database solution without the associated costs.

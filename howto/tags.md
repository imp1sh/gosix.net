# Tags

Tags are very important for the functionality of gosix.net. Using tags you can filter by category and by IPv6 compatibility status.

Do not create new tags, only use those defined on this page. Tags are always singular never plural. Don't assign manufacturer names as tags or the name of the software / product / container.

## Category tags
Currently there are those category tags available:

- container
- datacenter
- device
- game
- iot
- isp 
- os
- software
- website
{.grid-list}

Every review can only have one of those tags.

## Rank tags
Rank tags flag the IPv6 compatibility status. 
- rank1
- rank2
- rank3
- flawed
- problematic
- nonexistant
- totalfailure
{.grid-list}

Every review can only have one of those tag, except the `totalfailure` tag can be assigned additionally. 

## Filtering by tag
A very convenient way to filter the reviews by tag is to hit the *Browse by Tags* button.

And then you can select one or multiple tags. In this example we show how to all websites that are rank6.

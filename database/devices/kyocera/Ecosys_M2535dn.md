# Kyocera Ecosys KM2535dn
IPv6 status: :2nd_place_medal:

DHCPv6 client: :ballot_box_with_check:
Static IP: :ballot_box_with_check:
Router Advertisement: :ballot_box_with_check:
WebGUI: :ballot_box_with_check:
Printing: :ballot_box_with_check:

For a printer of that age the IPv6 implementation is actually pretty good. There are some minor flaws like the settings for IPv6 are a bit sparse but it's really sufficient for most environments.

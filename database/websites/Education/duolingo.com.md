The website and its accompanying mobile application offer free, gamified lessons in a wide variety of languages, ranging from widely spoken ones like Spanish, French, and German, to less common tongues such as Welsh and Swahili. Designed to make language learning accessible and entertaining, Duolingo uses intuitive, interactive exercises that reinforce reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills through gradual progression and immersive techniques.

Each lesson is bite-sized, making it easy for learners to practice in short bursts throughout the day, ideal for busy individuals or those looking to incorporate a new language into their daily routine.

Duolingo Inc. has continued to expand the platform's features, introducing podcasts, stories, and even virtual one-on-one conversations with AI characters for some of the languages, further enriching the learning experience. This commitment to evolving and enhancing the accessibility of language education has propelled Duolingo to become one of the foremost language learning applications, with a thriving community of millions of users worldwide.

## What is www.foundationdb.org about?
FoundationDB is a distributed database engineered to provide highly scalable and fault-tolerant data storage with strong consistency guarantees. Initially developed by a company of the same name, FoundationDB was acquired by Apple Inc. in 2015. The technology is designed to handle large volumes of structured data and support complex, multi-model data structures, making it a versatile choice for a variety of applications.

What sets FoundationDB apart is its unique architecture that combines the advantages of NoSQL databases with the reliability of ACID transactions, ensuring that all database operations are atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable. This means that FoundationDB can execute multiple database operations in a single, coherent transaction without sacrificing performance or scalability.

After a period of being closed-source post-acquisition, Apple re-released FoundationDB as an open-source project in 2018, allowing the developer community to contribute to its growth and improvement. This move helped invigorate the project, as it now benefits from transparent development and a wider pool of contributors, ensuring its continued relevance and evolution in the fast-paced world of database technology.

## What is google.com about?
Google.com is the flagship search engine platform developed and maintained by Alphabet Inc., an American multinational conglomerate. It was originally founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, and has since become the world's most widely used search engine. Google's search engine is known for its simple, clean interface and its ability to deliver relevant search results quickly, using a complex algorithm that considers over 200 factors to rank pages.

Beyond its search capabilities, Google.com has evolved into a gateway for a plethora of services and applications, including Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive, and the Chrome web browser, among others. It has transformed the way information is consumed and disseminated online, making it a critical tool for individuals and businesses alike. With its mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, Google has consistently aimed to innovate and improve its services, maintaining its position as a leader in the technology industry.

Alphabet Inc., established in 2015, serves as the parent holding company of Google and several former Google subsidiaries. The reorganization into Alphabet was done with the intent of making the tech giant's activities cleaner and more accountable as it expands beyond its core search and advertising business into various sectors, including self-driving cars (Waymo), health technology (Verily), and cutting-edge tech research (Google X).

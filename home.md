# The IPv6 compatibility database


**Welcome to the **gosix.net** #IPv6 compatibility database.**
Here we blame those who fail at implementing IPv6 but we also document products with good IPv6 support.
gosix.net IPv6 compatibility database is a database that registers the IPv6 compatibility status for: bla

##  :computer: Devices
This is about devices that have a network port or WiFi and don't run a classic computer OS but rather a firmware. 

## :keyboard: Software
The category of software is divided into client and server software. Both need IPv6 capabilities in order to support the current Internet Protocol.

## :space_invader: IOT
This is a lot like the devices category but those are generally smaller devices that serve in Home Automation or similar applications.

## :apple: Operating Systems
The landscape of Operating Systems is broader than you might think. There is not only Windows, macOS and Linux. This also covers the mobile devices OS market.

## :joystick: Games
This is basically software, too but since it's a huge portion and also because there are games for consoles they get their own category.

## :spider_web: Websites
We plan to dynamically check wheter or not a website supports IPv6 by requesting its AAAA record and check if an HTTP connection via IPv6 is possible.

## :stop_button: Container Images
Container images are preconfigured applications. Depending on what the maintainer does the container image may or may not support IPv6.

## :globe_with_meridians: Internet Service Provider (ISP)
Internet Service Providers sometimes fail big time on providing the clients with proper IPv6 connectivity.

## :link: Datacenter providers
Datacenters usually have proper IPv6 connectivity for their customers but there are also black sheep.

## Rankings

There is a ranking of how good the IPv6 compatibility is

| Name | Tag | Symbol | Symbol Code | Description |  
| - | - | - | - | - | 
| perfect | rank1 | :1st_place_medal: | `:1st_place_medal:` | there is nothing to complain about, at all |
| very good | rank2 | :2nd_place_medal: | `:2nd_place_medal:` | it's mostly perfect but there are few but mostly not very important flaws |
| not bad | rank3 | :3rd_place_medal: | `:3rd_place_medal:` | IPv6 support is good but there are few annoying flaws or some more not very important flaws |
| flawed | rank4 | :arrow_down: | `:arrow_down:` | IPv6 support is somewhat there but there are too many flaws to make good use of it.
| problematic | rank5 | :arrow_double_down: | `:arrow_double_down:` | IPv6 support is very incomplete, major flaws
| nonexistent | rank6 | :x: | `:x:` | There is no IPv6 support at all |
| totalfailure | totalfailure | :wastebasket: | `:wastebasket:` | This is a special award for companies that have no interest in the foreseeable future to support IPv6 |

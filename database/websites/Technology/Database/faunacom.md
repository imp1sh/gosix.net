## What is fauna.com about?
Fauna, Inc. provides a cloud-based, serverless database service known as FaunaDB, which is designed to simplify the complexities of modern application development. FaunaDB offers a unique combination of features from traditional databases, such as relational databases, with the scalability of NoSQL solutions. It is a globally distributed database that provides strong consistency, rich indexing, and multi-tenancy capabilities. This allows developers to build complex, data-driven applications without worrying about the operational overhead of database management.

One of the standout features of FaunaDB is its query language, the Fauna Query Language (FQL), which is expressive and allows for complex queries similar to SQL. Additionally, FaunaDB embraces the JAMstack philosophy and offers seamless integration with serverless computing and modern frontend technologies. It's built with a focus on security and provides fine-grained access control, making it easy to build applications with complex data access patterns.

Fauna, Inc. positions FaunaDB as a solution catered to the needs of modern development, where application scale, global distribution, real-time data access, and ease of use are paramount. By reducing the need for database provisioning, scaling, and maintenance, FaunaDB helps developers to focus more on building their applications and less on the underlying database infrastructure.

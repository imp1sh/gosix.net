## What is www.scylladb.com about?
ScyllaDB is a real-time big data database that is designed to power high-performance applications at scale. Built as a drop-in replacement for Apache Cassandra, ScyllaDB offers developers and organizations a more robust and scalable database solution. It is engineered to make optimal use of modern multi-core CPUs and fast storage systems such as SSDs. This results in a significant improvement in throughput and latency, granting ScyllaDB the capability to handle massive amounts of data with impressive speed.

One of the standout features of ScyllaDB is its self-optimizing capabilities which allow for minimal maintenance overhead. The database automatically tunes itself based on the workload and resources, ensuring consistent high performance without manual intervention. Moreover, ScyllaDB provides strong consistency with support for advanced replication techniques that ensure data safety and integrity across multiple datacenters. Designed to be API-compatible with Cassandra, ScyllaDB allows easy migration and integration with existing Cassandra applications, lowering the barrier for adoption.

ScyllaDB's architecture is not just about raw speed; it also promises enhanced availability and reliability. It is built to be fault-tolerant, ensuring that services remain up and running even when parts of the infrastructure fail. The combination of low-latency, high-throughput performance, and robust fault tolerance makes ScyllaDB an attractive option for businesses that require a database solution capable of accommodating rapidly evolving data demands.

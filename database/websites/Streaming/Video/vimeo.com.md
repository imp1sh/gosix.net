Vimeo.com, owned by IAC (InterActiveCorp), is a leading video hosting, sharing, and services platform that caters to creative professionals, businesses, and individuals seeking a high-quality environment to upload and display their videos. Distinct from other video platforms like YouTube, Vimeo is known for its ad-free model, which provides a cleaner viewing experience focused on the content rather than interruption by ads. With its sleek interface and supportive community, Vimeo has become a hub for filmmakers, animators, and artists to showcase and monetize their work, as well as for companies to host and share video content internally or with their clientele.

Aside from hosting videos, Vimeo also offers a suite of tools for video creation, collaboration, and distribution. It supports high-definition and 4K video uploads and provides robust privacy settings that allow creators to control who views their content. On the business side, Vimeo's services include analytics, marketing capabilities, and the option to build custom video websites. As a subsidiary of IAC, a media and internet company comprised of notable brands across 100 countries, Vimeo benefits from the parent company's expertise in scaling and developing online services, positioning it as a premium platform in a competitive digital video space.

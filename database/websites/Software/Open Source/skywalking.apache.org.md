## What is skywalking.apache.org about?
Apache SkyWalking is an open-source application performance monitoring (APM) system designed by the Apache Software Foundation to monitor, trace, and diagnose distributed systems, especially those built using microservices, cloud-native, and container-based architectures. It provides an end-to-end observability analysis by collecting data from multiple sources, including service, service instance, endpoint, and network, thereby delivering a comprehensive view of system performance and behavior.

SkyWalking offers a user-friendly UI to visualize complex distributed scenarios and presents the data in a way that is easy to understand. It employs a polyglot agent-based and agentless data collection mechanism that supports various languages and frameworks. Moreover, SkyWalking employs advanced techniques like Distributed Tracing to track the journey of requests across service boundaries, which is critical for diagnosing bottlenecks or failures in distributed systems.

The platform is highly extensible and supports a wide range of observability techniques like metric aggregation, topology map analysis, and alarm systems. Its capabilities make it an ideal choice for businesses undergoing digital transformation to cloud-native architectures, as it helps maintain system reliability and performance. As a project under the reputable Apache Software Foundation umbrella, SkyWalking benefits from a strong community that continually contributes to its improvement and innovation.

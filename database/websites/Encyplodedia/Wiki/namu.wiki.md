## What is namu.wiki about?
Namu.wiki is a Korean collaborative online encyclopedia that operates on a wiki model, where users can create, edit, and organize articles on a wide array of subjects. The name "Namu" translates to "tree" in Korean, symbolizing the growth and branching nature of knowledge that the platform embodies. As a community-driven project, it draws inspiration from various other wikis, such as Wikipedia, but with a focus on user freedom and a less stringent content policy.

Namu.wiki distinguishes itself with a rich repository of cultural and internet meme-related content, reflecting the diverse interests of its Korean user base. It embraces a mix of formal and informal language, allowing for a broader range of topics and a more approachable tone. Articles on the site cover everything from historical events, scientific concepts, and biographies to pop culture, gaming, and internet phenomena.

Unlike some other encyclopedias, namu.wiki is known for its liberal approach to content, sometimes leading to highly detailed pages on niche subjects. This inclusivity has led to a vibrant and active community, with users continually updating and refining the information. However, like any user-curated knowledge base, the reliability of content can vary and is dependent on the contributions and oversight of its user community.

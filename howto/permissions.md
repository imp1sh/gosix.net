# Permissions

There are different user groups, i.e.

## :new: New users
When a new user registers they automatically become a member of the `New Users` group. This grants them the ability to add comments.


## :writing_hand: Contributors
A contributor can add / edit content. If you would like to become a contributor, please ask in our [chat](/howto/chat).


## :point_up: Moderators
Moderators have the same permissions as [contributors](/howto/permissions#contributors) but on top they can
- delete pages
- rename / move pages


## :punch: Administrators
Administrators have all privileges there are. Currently it's not intended for a user to become an Administrator.

## Rankings

There is a ranking of how good the IPv6 compatibility is

| Name | Tag | Symbol | Symbol Code | Description |  
| - | - | - | - | - | 
| perfect | rank1 | :1st_place_medal: | `:1st_place_medal:` | there is nothing to complain about, at all |
| very good | rank2 | :2nd_place_medal: | `:2nd_place_medal:` | it's mostly perfect but there are few but mostly not very important flaws |
| not bad | rank3 | :3rd_place_medal: | `:3rd_place_medal:` | IPv6 support is good but there are few annoying flaws or some more not very important flaws |
| flawed | rank4 | :arrow_down: | `:arrow_down:` | IPv6 support is somewhat there but there are too many flaws to make good use of it.
| problematic | rank5 | :arrow_double_down: | `:arrow_double_down:` | IPv6 support is very incomplete, major flaws
| nonexistent | rank6 | :x: | `:x:` | There is no IPv6 support at all |
| totalfailure | totalfailure | :wastebasket: | `:wastebasket:` | This is a special award for companies that have no interest in the foreseeable future to support IPv6 |

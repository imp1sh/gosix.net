## What is handwiki.org about?
HandWiki.org is an online compendium that serves as a wiki-based knowledge portal for various scientific, technical and computing topics. It is designed to be a comprehensive resource, where experts, researchers, and practitioners can contribute and share information. Unlike general encyclopedias, HandWiki focuses specifically on areas that require a deep understanding of subjects such as physics, mathematics, computer science, and many other branches of knowledge that have academic or practical significance.

The platform offers a collaborative environment similar to other wikis, providing a space for detailed articles, explanations, and discussions. HandWiki distinguishes itself by encouraging the inclusion of highly specialized content that may not typically find a place in broader wikis. Additionally, it has the distinctive feature of enabling the embedding of complex mathematical expressions and scientific data within its articles, making it a useful resource for professionals and academics who seek precise and technical information.

One of the central aims of HandWiki is to serve as a reliable reference that promotes the sharing of know-how and innovative ideas among its users. It provides an accessible medium for individuals to disseminate their expertise, contributing to a collective pool of knowledge that is constantly growing and evolving, benefiting those engaged in both theoretical research and practical applications.

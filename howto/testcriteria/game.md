# Test Criteria Game

{.is-warning}

Either computer games or console games often communicate with servers for mulitplayer and other stuff. Especially on consoles those connection are IPv4 only. This leads to immense problems especially when CGNAT or other centralized nodes are used. When a game is IPv6 compatible it usually works much better.
This is not about game servers here. For that go to the **Software** chapter.

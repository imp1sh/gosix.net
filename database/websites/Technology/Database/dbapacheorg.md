## What is db.apache.org about?
The Apache DB project is an endeavor by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) to develop and provide a wide array of database resources that can be utilized by the open-source community. These resources consist of both relational and non-relational database systems, and also include tools and APIs to facilitate database access, interaction, and development.

Apache DB primarily focuses on two key database products: Apache Derby and Apache Daffodil. Apache Derby is an SQL-based relational database implemented entirely in Java, known for its portability, ease of use, and embeddable nature. It's particularly favored for small to medium-sized applications. Apache Daffodil, meanwhile, implements the Data Format Description Language (DFDL) to enable the parsing and serialization of fixed-format data and is versatile in the application for data interchange.

Structured to cater to a diverse range of database needs, the Apache DB project encourages an inclusive development process and invites contributions from developers worldwide. This goes hand in hand with ASF's ethos of collaborative development and its commitment to producing software for the public good. Through its rigorous open-source methodologies, the Apache DB project maintains a standard of high quality and robustness in its database solutions.

## What is www.actavis.com about?
Actavis was once a prominent name in the pharmaceutical industry, recognized for its generic and specialty pharmaceutical products. After a series of mergers and acquisitions, Actavis was acquired by Allergan plc. Later, in May 2020, Allergan was acquired by AbbVie Inc., a global biopharmaceutical company with a commitment to developing advanced therapies for some of the world's most complex and critical conditions.

The legacy of Actavis endures within AbbVie as part of a larger portfolio of pharmaceuticals. AbbVie continues to drive innovation in key therapeutic areas, including immunology, oncology, neuroscience, eye care, virology, women's health, and gastroenterology, as well as products from the Allergan Aesthetics portfolio. With a robust R&D pipeline and a dedication to addressing significant health challenges, AbbVie strives to have a remarkable impact on people's lives.

As Actavis's digital footprint has been assumed under the AbbVie brand, information on the Actavis products and initiatives now falls under the AbbVie umbrella. Those interested in the lineup of products that originally stemmed from Actavis can find relevant information and updates directly through the AbbVie website or contact channels. AbbVie aims to provide a seamless experience for healthcare providers, patients, and stakeholders, maintaining a commitment to quality, safety, and efficacy across its product range.

# Image Upload

As a contributor you can upload images to this website. Those images are put in a hierarchical structure. Please always use the existing structure or put the image in the same directory, where the document is. You might need to create the folder first.

---

In Markdown mode you need to hit the folder icon to the left.

Next you will have to navigate to the folder you want to put the image into. Continue until you reached your destination folder.

If the folder is not there yet, please create it.

When you reached your destination you can have a look, if a fitting element is already there to insert or you can upload one by hitting this button. Please make sure the filename is set to a speaking value. The image will be uploaded to the folder you chose before this step.

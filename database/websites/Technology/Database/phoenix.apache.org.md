## What is phoenix.apache.org about?
Apache Phoenix is a relational database layer over Hadoop that enables users to run SQL queries on Apache HBase, a NoSQL data store. It is developed by the Apache Software Foundation, known for its large array of open-source software projects. Phoenix is designed to make HBase accessible to developers who already have SQL experience, providing a JDBC driver that lets them use familiar SQL syntax instead of the more complex native HBase API. The project aims to bridge the gap between the capabilities of traditional RDBMS systems and the scalability of Hadoop.

The core of Apache Phoenix lies in its ability to compile SQL queries into native HBase scans, manipulating the data directly in HBase without additional layers. This design allows Phoenix to provide near real-time performance, making it an appealing choice for systems that need fast query responses on big data sets. Phoenix is optimized for handling large-scale data challenges and takes advantage of HBase's scalability and robustness.

Phoenix also provides additional features such as secondary indexes, full and partial schema support, transaction support, and operational tools to ease database management and monitoring. It's an excellent choice for enterprises looking to leverage big data analytics with traditional SQL knowledge, without the steep learning curve associated with NoSQL solutions. Apache Phoenix is continually evolving with contributions from a vibrant open-source community, ensuring that it remains a powerful and flexible tool for data access at scale.

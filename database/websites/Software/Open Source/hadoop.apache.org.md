## What is hadoop.apache.org about?
Hadoop is a comprehensive ecosystem of open source components provided by the Apache Software Foundation that deals with the storage and large-scale processing of data. Predominantly known for the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and the MapReduce computing paradigm, Hadoop enables the user to store vast amounts of data in a distributed fashion across multiple machines, while providing the tools to perform parallel processing on that data.

The core of Hadoop consists of the HDFS for storage, which ensures high availability and fault tolerance through data replication across the cluster nodes. Alongside HDFS, Hadoop also includes YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which manages computing resources in clusters and utilizes them for scheduling users' applications. The second core component, MapReduce, allows for the processing of large datasets with a distributed algorithm on a Hadoop cluster.

Being an Apache top-level project, Hadoop's development is driven by an open and collaborative community of developers and users. The ecosystem has expanded to include a number of related projects such as Apache Hive for SQL-like query capabilities, Apache HBase for NoSQL data storage, Apache Spark for in-memory data processing, and others, each serving specific data processing needs and complementing the overall functionality of Hadoop. Its scalable nature and comprehensive toolset make Hadoop essential for enterprises needing to handle large volumes of data with flexibility and efficiency.

The community is growing fast. We gained seven new members during the last days. 

## Test criteria

Currently the most important topic is to find a good list of criteria for the different categories. We don't want to be too strict but for gaining `rank1` :1st_place_medal: the bar should not be too low either.
So if you add new content I currently suggest to make a list of what you find e.g. your provider is good at or still has flaws. Only when the test criteria is complete we will have a reliable method of finding a good rank for all of the different things.

I just opened up the category [/howto/testcriteria](/howto/testcriteria) for contributors to edit. Feel free to add content there. 

Thank you for your participation

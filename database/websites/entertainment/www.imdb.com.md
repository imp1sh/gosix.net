## What is www.imdb.com about?
IMDb, which stands for Internet Movie Database, is an online database owned by Amazon.com Inc. that provides an extensive repository of information related to films, television series, video games, and online streaming content. Founded in 1990 by Col Needham, it started as a hobby project to list credits, biographies, plot summaries, and trivia about movies. It quickly became an indispensable resource for movie enthusiasts, industry professionals, and casual viewers alike.

IMDb offers a detailed catalogue featuring cast and crew biographies, production details, and box office data. Users can find virtually any information related to entertainment content such as ratings, reviews, character information, and quotes. It has also grown to include user-generated content like forums, polls, and lists, building a community aspect to the site.

Over the years, IMDb has extended its service with IMDbPro, a subscription-based branch that offers contact information for industry insiders, and Box Office Mojo, a website tracking box office revenue. It also provides a platform for viewing trailers, giving showtimes, and ticket purchasing. Through Amazon's ownership, IMDb has further expanded its features and integrated with Amazon's Prime Video service, allowing Amazon Prime members to access streaming content directly through IMDb's interface.

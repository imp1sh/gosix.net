## What is kylin.apache.org about?
Kylin by Apache Software Foundation is an open-source distributed analytics engine designed to provide a SQL interface and multi-dimensional analysis (OLAP) on Apache Hadoop, supporting extremely large datasets. Originally developed by eBay and later contributed to the Apache Software Foundation, Apache Kylin aims to bridge the gap between big data and traditional OLAP capabilities, allowing users to analyze massive datasets with sub-second query latency.

Apache Kylin uses pre-computed materialized views to dramatically increase query speed on big data. It converts raw data into a more structured format stored in Hadoop, which is then used to perform OLAP cube operations. This pre-processing step allows for efficient query processing and enhances the data retrieval speed, making it particularly suitable for businesses which require interactive analytics on petabyte-scale data warehouses.

The ecosystem around Kylin has grown since its inception, with continuous improvements and features being added. It supports a variety of Hadoop components, such as Hive, HBase, and Spark, integrating well with existing big data systems. Kylin's adoption across various industries signifies its robustness and effectiveness in managing and processing large-scale, multidimensional data, providing a powerful tool for data analysts and business intelligence professionals.

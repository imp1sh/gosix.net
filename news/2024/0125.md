## Automatic websites test
I'm currently working on automatic websites tests. I'm writing a script that checks the IPv6 status of e.g. github.com and then pushes the result to the wiki.js api or writing it to a git repo, which brings me to my next topic.

## Git repo sync
Wikijs can store the data in several backends. I plan to activate a git repo backend which will sync to this page. This way users can not only contribute to this page by creating an account here but also by pull requests against the git repo.

I will keep you posted.

# January 25th, 2024 (Update)
Well that went much easier than expected. Starting now you can contribute to this wiki by creating pull requests to the corresponding [git repo](https://github.com/imp1sh/gosix.net). The content is synced every 5 minutes bi-directionally. So changes from the website are pushed towards git and vice versa. As a matter of fact, this news entry comes through the git.

## What is pluto.tv about?
Pluto TV, a subsidiary of ViacomCBS, represents a unique twist in the evolving landscape of streaming services. Launched in 2013, Pluto TV offers a free, ad-supported service that mimics the traditional TV viewing experience by providing an array of live channels alongside an on-demand content library. Unlike subscription-based platforms, it does not require viewers to sign up or pay a monthly fee, thereby democratizing access to entertainment.

The service boasts a diverse selection of content, with hundreds of channels that provide news, sports, movies, TV shows, and even internet-based content such as web series and viral videos. Pluto TV's interface resembles that of a classic cable TV guide, making the transition to digital streaming seamless for those accustomed to traditional television. Through curated channels and genres, viewers can stumble upon various programming just as they would by channel surfing, offering a sense of serendipity often lost in the era of algorithm-driven platforms.

With its acquisition by ViacomCBS in 2019, Pluto TV has expanded its library to include content from CBS's vast archives, along with offerings from other ViacomCBS entities. This strategic move has bolstered the platform's competitive edge in the free streaming space while providing ViacomCBS with a valuable avenue to reach a broader audience, including cord-cutters and younger generations gravitating away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.

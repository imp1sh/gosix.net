## What is www.bverwg.de about?
The website www.bverwg.de is the official online presence of the Bundesverwaltungsgericht, which is the Federal Administrative Court of Germany. This court is one of the five supreme federal courts in the country and is located in Leipzig. As an apex court for administrative law, it hears cases that involve disputes between citizens and the state, and it plays a pivotal role in ensuring that administrative acts and decisions comply with the law.

The Bundesverwaltungsgericht serves as the final instance of appeal for matters concerning administrative law, except for constitutional issues, which are dealt with by the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht). The court's judgments can have far-reaching implications for the interpretation and application of German administrative law.

On the website, visitors can access a wealth of information, including the court's history, structure, and procedures. It provides detailed insights into the court's jurisdiction, case law, and press releases. Legal professionals, as well as interested members of the public, can find recent decisions and information on forthcoming hearings. Additionally, the site offers guidance for those who wish to bring a case before the court, making it a crucial resource for understanding the administrative judiciary in Germany.

## What is www.celgene.com about?
As of my last update in April 2023, Celgene Corporation was a global biopharmaceutical company that was acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) in November 2019. Originally established in 1986, Celgene became known for its innovative treatments in areas such as oncology and inflammatory disorders. One of its most notable products was Revlimid (lenalidomide), which has been widely used for the treatment of multiple myeloma and certain types of blood disorders.

The acquisition by Bristol Myers Squibb has expanded BMS's portfolio, particularly strengthening its position in oncology, hematology, immunology, and cardiovascular disease. The combined entity leverages Celgene's research and development expertise with BMS's extensive resources and commercial capabilities to enhance its commitment to bringing innovative medicines to patients with serious diseases.

Since the merger, the Celgene website might redirect users to the Bristol Myers Squibb site, reflecting the integration of the two companies. The vision and mission of the combined company focus on life-changing treatments and pioneering scientific advancements. Celgene, under the umbrella of BMS, continues to be at the forefront of biomedical research with the goal of driving the next wave of innovative therapies for patients around the world.

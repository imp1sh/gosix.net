## What is opencv.org about?
OpenCV.org is the official website for the Open Source Computer Vision Library, known as OpenCV, which serves as a hub for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The OpenCV project was launched in 1999 by Intel, and since then it has become one of the most popular libraries for implementing computer vision tasks. The website is maintained by a dedicated OpenCV team along with contributions from a vibrant community of users who work together to keep the project evolving and up-to-date. It offers a wealth of resources including documentation, tutorials, and code examples to help individuals learn and apply computer vision techniques in their projects.

With the support of Intel, OpenCV.org ensures that the library utilizes cutting-edge technology and is optimized for performance, particularly on Intel hardware. However, its open-source nature has allowed it to grow beyond its origins to support a wide array of platforms and programming languages including Python, C++, and Java. The site not only serves as a repository for the library's source code but also provides updates on new releases, upcoming events, and opportunities for community members to get involved. Whether you're just starting out in the field or you're a seasoned professional, OpenCV.org is a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their computer vision skills and contribute to an ever-evolving project.

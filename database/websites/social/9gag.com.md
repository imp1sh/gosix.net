9GAG.com is a social media platform that started as a simple website where users could share humorous images, memes, GIFs, and videos. Co-founded by Ray Chan and a team of Hong Kong entrepreneurs in 2008, the site has grown to become one of the most popular entertainment portals on the internet, known for its engaging content that spans a wide range of topics, from pop culture to gaming and everything in between.

With a community-driven approach, 9GAG encourages user participation through upvotes, downvotes, and comments, effectively curating the content that becomes most visible.

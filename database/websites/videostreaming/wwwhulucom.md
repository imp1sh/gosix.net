## What is www.hulu.com about?
Hulu is an American subscription video-on-demand service fully controlled and majority-owned by The Walt Disney Company, with Comcast's NBCUniversal holding a minority stake. It stands as a leading platform in the competitive streaming marketplace, offering an extensive library of TV shows, movies, and original content. Hulu's varied selection ranges from current-season television episodes from major networks, which often appear on the service just a day after airing, to critically acclaimed original series and films. 

Hulu differentiates itself from other streaming giants with its unique offerings, such as the option to add Live TV, featuring over 75 live and on-demand channels that include sports and news. The platform also caters to various viewing preferences by providing tiered subscription settings, allowing users to choose between an ad-supported plan and a higher-priced ad-free experience. Additionally, Hulu works in conjunction with Disney's other streaming services, Disney+ and ESPN+, to offer a bundled package, further solidifying its position as a comprehensive source for entertainment. 

The service has garnered attention for its original content, which includes award-winning shows like "The Handmaid's Tale." Such series have not only expanded Hulu's viewership but have also established it as a significant player in the domain of original online content creation, competing alongside Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and other OTT platforms. With its ever-expanding library and commitment to innovation, Hulu continues to be an attractive option for streamers seeking diversity and quality in their entertainment choices.

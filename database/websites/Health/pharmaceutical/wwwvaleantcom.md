## What is www.valeant.com about?
Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. was a multinational specialty pharmaceutical company based in Laval, Quebec, Canada. It specialized in developing, manufacturing, and marketing a broad range of prescription and over-the-counter products focusing on dermatology, eye health, neurology, and branded generics. However, the company was involved in controversies related to its business practices and accounting matters, which led to major changes in its operations and management.

In 2018, in an effort to move past its troubled history and build a new positive image, Valeant Pharmaceuticals rebranded itself as Bausch Health Companies Inc. Bausch Health has been working on restoring its reputation by streamlining its product portfolio, focusing on life-enhancing products, and emphasizing R&D to bring new innovative treatments to the market. The company aims to improve the lives of patients globally by offering a diverse range of medical products across its areas of expertise. Although the official website of Valeant now redirects to Bausch Health's website, the legacy of Valeant's expansive range of products and experience in the pharmaceutical industry is carried forward under the new Bausch Health umbrella.

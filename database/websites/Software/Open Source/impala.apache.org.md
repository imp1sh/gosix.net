## What is impala.apache.org about?
Impala is an open-source, native analytic database for Apache Hadoop, developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is designed to provide high-performance, low-latency SQL queries on data stored in Hadoop file formats, enabling users to perform real-time analysis on large-scale datasets. Unlike other Hadoop query systems that are batch-oriented, Impala utilizes a massively parallel processing (MPP) SQL engine that allows for interactive exploration and fine-tuning of analytic queries, making it a suitable solution for Big Data environments where speed and interactivity are crucial.

Impala supports the most common SQL functionality, including JOINs and aggregate functions, making it compatible with existing business intelligence tools and infrastructure. It also integrates seamlessly with the Hadoop ecosystem, allowing users to query data in HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and Apache HBase without data movement or transformation. The system scales linearly with the addition of commodity hardware, and because it operates within the Hadoop framework, it leverages Hadoop's authentication, authorization, and data compression mechanisms.

Overall, Apache Impala is an important tool in the Hadoop ecosystem for organizations looking to perform quick, on-the-fly queries on large-scale datasets. Its integration with existing tools and security systems, along with its MPP SQL engine, helps bridge the gap between Big Data processing and traditional SQL data warehouses, making it a popular choice for real-time Big Data analytics.

## What is pandas.pydata.org about?
Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on top of the Python programming language. It offers robust, flexible, and efficient data structures like DataFrame and Series, which make working with structured data seamless for developers and data scientists. Conceived by Wes McKinney in 2008, pandas has since evolved into a vital component of the Python data science stack, often used in conjunction with libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for a wide range of data processing tasks.

NumFOCUS, a nonprofit organization promoting sustainable, high-quality open source scientific computing, is the steward of pandas. NumFOCUS provides pandas with fiscal, legal, and administrative support, helping to ensure that the project remains active and well-maintained. Through sponsorship and a focus on community-driven development, they foster the growth of pandas, ensuring that it remains accessible and free for everyone to use. This relationship underscores a commitment to open science and the advancement of data analysis tools in Python, benefiting a diverse user base across academia, industry, and research sectors.

# Minecraft Server (Paper)

To be clear, this document is about running the [Paper Server for Minecraft](https://papermc.io/), not the vanilla version of Minecraft.

Without any special configuration the paper server will both listen on IPv4 as well as IPv6, at least on Linux. On FreeBSD I remember there were some drawbacks and I think it didn't work with IPv6 there.

So contrary to a common believe, Minecraft is IPv6 compatible :1st_place_medal:

## What is www.sqlite.org about?
SQLite is a renowned software library that provides a relational database management system (RDBMS) to applications without the need for a separate server process. Developed by the SQLite Consortium, it's recognized for its lightweight and self-contained nature, with the entire database engine being fully integrated into the host application. www.sqlite.org serves as the primary platform for the distribution of this software, offering comprehensive documentation, downloads of the latest versions, and resources for developers.

The design philosophy of SQLite centers around reliability, simplicity, and the principle of being zero-config, which means that no setup or administration is needed. It adheres to ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensuring that database transactions are processed reliably, and it supports most of the SQL standard features. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not run as a separate process with which the application communicates. Instead, the SQLite library is linked in with the application and runs as an integral part of the application.

SQLite is ubiquitously used in various applications, from small-scale projects and embedded devices to large-scale services and applications, including web browsers, mobile phones, and operating systems. Its public domain licensing allows for integration into any application without the requirement for license fees or royalties, thus making it a go-to choice for developers around the world looking for an efficient and cost-effective database solution. The Consortium's website is a vital resource for gaining access to the technology and understanding its comprehensive utility.

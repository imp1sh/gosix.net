## What is zipkin.apache.org about?
Zipkin is a distributed tracing system developed by The Apache Software Foundation. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. The system is inspired by Google's Dapper paper and supports the collection of timing data from disparate services to monitor and resolve issues regarding complex service architectures.

At the heart of Zipkin is the ability to trace requests through a series of services in near real-time. This provides visibility into the system, allowing developers and operations teams to pinpoint the cause of increased latency, identify performance bottlenecks, and understand the flow of requests through their applications. This is critical in a microservices ecosystem, where a single user operation may involve multiple services that can be scattered across different systems or even different data centers.

Zipkin's intake of trace data is quite flexible; it can ingest information via HTTP, Kafka, or RabbitMQ. It then processes and stores this data using in-memory storage, a database or even searches indexes like Elasticsearch for scalable storage and query capabilities. The front-end user interface simplifies the task of analyzing trace data and presenting it in a coherent fashion. This allows for easy drill-down into individual services or operations, making Root Cause Analysis (RCA) faster and more efficient.

## What is zookeeper.apache.org about?
Apache ZooKeeper is an open-source server which enables highly reliable distributed coordination. Developed by the Apache Software Foundation, it is essentially a service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. All of these kinds of services are used in some form or another by distributed applications.

At its core, ZooKeeper maintains a simple hierarchical namespace, much like a file system, that allows clients to read and write to nodes, called znodes. These znodes can be used by distributed systems to manage shared data and to implement higher-level services for synchronization, such as leader election, configuration maintenance, and group membership.

ZooKeeper's architecture is designed to be robust. It operates on an ensemble of servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Clients can connect to any node in the ZooKeeper ensemble and operations are forwarded to the leader for processing. In case of leader failure, ZooKeeper automatically elects a new leader without interrupting client service. ZooKeeper aims to provide a simple and high performance kernel for building more complex coordination primitives at the client. Its efficiency and reliability make it ideal for large-scale distributed systems.

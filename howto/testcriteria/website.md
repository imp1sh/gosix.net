# Test Criteria Website

> This document is unfinished. Help adding criteria
{.is-warning}

We should concentrate on sites that do NOT support IPv6 yet. Otherwise the database could get flooded with sites that are working with v6 which in turn wouldn't help very much.

| criteria | importance | description |
| - | - | - |
| AAAA record | must have | check if the domain name has an AAAA record |
| IPv6 connectivity | must have | check if a connection to the site via IPv6 is successful |

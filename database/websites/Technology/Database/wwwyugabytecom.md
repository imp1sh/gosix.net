## What is www.yugabyte.com about?
Yugabyte, Inc. is a company behind the development of YugabyteDBâ€”an open-source, high-performance, distributed SQL database designed for global, internet-scale applications. It offers the benefits of traditional SQL databases in terms of ACID transactions and strong consistency, while ensuring horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and resilience, akin to NoSQL databases. Combining these attributes makes it ideal for businesses that require a database solution capable of adapting to rapidly changing demands without compromising on the reliability and familiarity of SQL.

One of YugabyteDB's key features is its ability to provide distributed SQL capabilities. It does so by implementing the Raft consensus algorithm for distributed transactions and using a Google Spanner-inspired sharding technique, which distributes data across multiple nodes to ensure high availability and low-latency access. Moreover, YugabyteDB supports geo-distribution of data, allowing for deployments across multiple regions or cloud providers, enabling businesses to meet strict data residency requirements and minimize latency by bringing data closer to users.

Yugabyte, Inc. positions its flagship product as a future-proof solution for enterprises looking to transition from monolithic database architectures to cloud-native and microservices-oriented designs without losing the SQL capabilities that developers and enterprises rely on. With features like automatic failover, support for various programming languages, and a strong emphasis on both performance and consistency, YugabyteDB remains an attractive option for modern, data-driven businesses.

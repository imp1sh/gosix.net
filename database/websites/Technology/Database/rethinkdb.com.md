## What is rethinkdb.com about?
RethinkDB is an open-source, scalable JSON database built from the ground up to facilitate the development of real-time web applications. It distinguishes itself with an intuitive query language, ReQL, which is designed to allow developers to perform complex queries by chaining commands. This allows for more readable and maintainable code, and queries are automatically parallelized across multiple cores.

With RethinkDB, realtime functionality is at the forefront. Changes to the database can be streamed to applications in real-time, so developers can easily build scalable, high-speed, and real-time web applications. This feature is particularly attractive in collaborative environments, gaming, and any scenario where immediate data updates are crucial.

Moreover, RethinkDB is designed with ease of use in mind, offering a user-friendly administrative console that makes managing the database, running queries, and troubleshooting issues more straightforward. The community around RethinkDB is active and supportive, contributing to a wealth of resources and tools that facilitate its adoption and use in a variety of applications.

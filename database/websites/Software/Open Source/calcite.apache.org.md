## What is calcite.apache.org about?
Calcite is an open-source dynamic data management framework maintained by the Apache Software Foundation under Apache Calcite. It provides a structured way to perform query processing across various data sources, making it easier to build systems that integrate data from multiple repositories with different structures and storage formats.

At the core of Apache Calcite lies its powerful query optimizer, which has a pluggable architecture allowing it to work with various storage engines and data formats. Calcite's optimizer leverages rules-based and cost-based optimization techniques to generate efficient query plans. Furthermore, Calcite supports a wide array of SQL dialects and extensions, including features such as complex joins, window functions, and grouping operations.

Calcite serves as a foundation for many well-known big data systems, like Apache Drill and Apache Flink, and can be embedded in applications that need to analyze data in real-time. Its adaptability makes it a staple in scenarios requiring custom data processing logic or when dealing with evolving schemas. With Calcite, developers can focus less on the internals of data processing and more on delivering robust, scalable solutions.

## What is tinkerpop.apache.org about?
Apache TinkerPop is an open-source graph computing framework managed by The Apache Software Foundation. It provides an analytical environment for different types of databases and systems by defining a set of structural and computational patterns to work on graph data. TinkerPop is versatile, allowing users to plug-and-play with different graph databases like Apache's own JanusGraph, Neo4j, and more, without changing the underlying code.

The core of TinkerPop is the Gremlin graph traversal language and machine. Gremlin is a powerful and flexible query language that can be used to manipulate complex graph structures both programmatically and interactively. It supports a variety of methods for deep graph analytics and OLTP-based graph manipulations. TinkerPop's Gremlin can be used across various programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, thanks to its language variants known as "Gremlin Language Variants" (GLVs).

TinkerPop's framework encourages broad ecosystem compatibility through its standardization efforts. This means developers can build applications on top of TinkerPop that will work with any TinkerPop-enabled graph system. It has proven to be foundational for projects requiring scalable, and complex graph processing, promoting the use of graph databases and computations across a wide array of industries.

## What is ukrat.de about?
Established in 2022, Germany's "UnabhÃ¤ngiger Kontrollrat" (Independent Oversight Council) acts as a crucial watchdog for citizen privacy. This independent body oversees the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), the country's foreign intelligence agency, wielding both judicial and administrative powers. Before the BND can conduct surveillance operations, the Council meticulously examines them, ensuring they adhere to strict legal guidelines. If necessary, the Council can even block measures deemed unlawful, safeguarding individual rights while enabling the BND to gather essential intelligence for national security. Viewed as a cornerstone of transparency and accountability in Germany's intelligence landscape, the Council plays a significant role in balancing individual rights with national security concerns.

## What is hive.apache.org about?
Apache Hive is a data warehouse software project built on top of Apache Hadoop for providing data query and analysis. Hive gives an SQL-like interface to query data stored in various databases and file systems that integrate with Hadoop, including the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Apache HBase, and others. Hive facilitates managing and querying large datasets residing in distributed storage.

Hive is designed to enable easy data summarization, ad-hoc queries, and the analysis of large volumes of data. It processes structured data in Hadoop. It provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL (HQL). At the same time, this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to plug in their custom mappers and reducers to handle more complex analysis that may not be supported by the built-in capabilities of the language.

Apache Hive's infrastructure lays the foundation for optimization opportunities. Since the queries are written in HiveQL, which are similar to SQL, it often attracts professionals who are experienced in SQL. This ease of use makes Apache Hive a popular choice among data analysts and engineers who are working in the ecosystem of big data technologies facilitated by the Apache Software Foundation.

## What is servicecomb.apache.org about?
Apache ServiceComb is an open-source microservices software framework by the Apache Software Foundation designed to simplify the development and management of microservices-based applications. The ServiceComb project provides a set of tools and capabilities that enable developers to build, test, deploy, and monitor applications that embrace the microservices architecture. This ecosystem is designed to be language-independent and supports various programming languages, thereby facilitating a broad developer user base.

The project is divided into two main components: ServiceComb Java Chassis and ServiceComb Service Center. ServiceComb Java Chassis allows developers to create microservice applications in Java without dealing with the complexity associated with distributed system communication, fault tolerance, and service registration/discovery. On the other hand, ServiceComb Service Center provides a platform for service registration, service discovery, configuration management, and other common functionalities required in distributed systems.

Apache ServiceComb is built with a focus on high performance and ease of use, integrating effortlessly with other Apache projects, and is suitable for businesses and applications of all sizes. It promotes a microservices-based approach to developing scalable and resilient applications and is continually supported and enhanced by an active community of contributors from various organizations.

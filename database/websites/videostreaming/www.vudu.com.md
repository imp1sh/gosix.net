## What is www.vudu.com about?
Vudu is an online streaming service originally owned by Walmart before being sold to Fandango Media. It provides an extensive library of movies and TV shows for purchase or rental, catering to an audience looking for immediate, on-demand access to the latest releases as well as classic films. Unlike subscription-based services, Vudu operates on a pay-per-view basis, meaning there's no monthly fee; users simply pay for the content they want to watch.

One of Vudu's standout features is its commitment to high-quality streaming, offering content in up to 4K UHD resolution with Dolby Vision and HDR10 support, catering to users with the latest home theater technology. Additionally, Vudu distinguishes itself with a feature called Movies Anywhere, allowing customers to consolidate their digital movie collections from various platforms into one place, making it a convenient hub for digital movies.

Vudu's user-friendly interface and diverse selection, combined with the ability to redeem and stream digital codes included in physical media packages, make it a popular choice for film enthusiasts and casual viewers alike. While it operates in a competitive field against giants like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Disney+, Vudu remains an appealing option for those who prefer owning or renting movies over subscription services.

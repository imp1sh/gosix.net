## What is storm.apache.org about?
Apache Storm is a free and open source distributed real-time computation system developed and maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. Designed to process vast amounts of data in a fault-tolerant and horizontal scalable method, Storm is renowned for its ability to perform complex data processing and analytics in real time. It is commonly used for a variety of applications, including real-time analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more.

Storm's architecture allows it to process unbounded streams of data with reliability guarantees that traditional batch-processing systems can't provide. It features a simple and flexible API that makes it easy to integrate with queueing systems and databases, allowing developers to build powerful data processing topologies. Storm topologies run across a cluster of machines, ensuring that data is processed quickly and reliably, even in the event of machine failures or other types of system outages.

Storm operates with the concept of "spouts" and "bolts." Spouts are responsible for producing the streams of data, while bolts process the input streams to produce new outputs. This division into spouts and bolts enables the creation of complex processing graphs that can scale across many nodes in a cluster. Additionally, Storm's lightweight process model enables it to support a multitude of languages, which means developers can work with the best tools for their particular use case. Overall, Apache Storm is a powerful tool for developers needing to process data in real-time at massive scale.

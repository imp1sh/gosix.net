## What is baike.baidu.com about?
Baike.baidu.com, powered by Baidu, Inc., is a large-scale Chinese-language collaborative online encyclopedia that operates similarly to Wikipedia. It serves as a comprehensive knowledge-sharing platform where users can create or edit articles on various topics, ranging from historical figures and scientific concepts to local culture and biographies of celebrities. Launched in April 2006, Baidu Baike has grown to become one of the most significant online encyclopedias in the Chinese-speaking world, capitalizing on the substantial user base of Baidu's search engine.

The platform functions through user contributions with an account registration requirement to ensure traceability and accountability of edits. Unlike Wikipedia, Baidu Baike adopts a more controlled approach to content management by having a stricter auditing system to oversee the information being posted or modified. This includes verifying content for accuracy, appropriateness, and compliance with Chinese laws and regulations, which aligns with Baidu's adherence to local internet governance.

The success of Baike.baidu.com can be attributed to its integration with Baidu's search engine, optimizing the visibility of its content in search results. Its user-friendly interface, local language advantage, and copious volume of content tailored to Chinese users have solidified its position as an essential online resource. Nonetheless, Baike's editorial policy receives criticism due to censorship and limited editorial freedoms compared to its Western counterparts. Despite these concerns, it remains a go-to source for millions seeking information in the Chinese language on a multitude of subjects.

## What is knox.apache.org about?
Apache Knox is a highly secure gateway developed by The Apache Software Foundation designed to provide perimeter security for services and applications offered within a Hadoop cluster. Its primary function is to simplify Hadoop security for users who access the cluster data and execute jobs. Knox achieves this by providing a single point of authentication and access for these services, that can be integrated with existing authentication mechanisms and has the added benefit of centralizing auditing of user access and system behavior.

The Apache Knox Gateway supports various REST APIs and Web UIs for interacting with Hadoop clusters. It acts as a reverse proxy, shielding the cluster from direct access by clients, which enhances security. Knox allows enterprises to extend their security infrastructure to Hadoop, enforcing authentication, authorization, and audit policies uniformly across all access points. This means that any data exchanges happen in a controlled and secure manner, compliant with enterprise security policies.

Given its design to protect sensitive cluster information and resources, Apache Knox is a go-to tool for organizations that seek a robust security model for their Hadoop ecosystem. It enables more secure access to Hadoop services for developers, data analysts, and applications, thus increasing the adoption of Hadoop in environments where security is a paramount concern.

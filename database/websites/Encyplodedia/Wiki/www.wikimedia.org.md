## What is www.wikimedia.org about?
www.wikimedia.org is the central web portal for the Wikimedia Foundation's galaxy of educational projects, which aims to bring free educational content to the world. The Wikimedia Foundation, a nonprofit organization, operates some of the largest collaboratively edited reference projects across the globe, with its most notable endeavor being Wikipedia. Wikipedia itself has become synonymous with free online information and stands as a testament to the power of volunteer contributors who work tirelessly to compile and verify information.

The Wikimedia Foundation's projects extend beyond Wikipedia, encompassing a variety of other initiatives designed to disseminate knowledge in multiple languages and formats. These include Wikimedia Commons, a repository of free-use images and media; Wiktionary, a multilingual dictionary and thesaurus; Wikiquote, a collection of quotations; and Wikibooks, which offers a range of textbooks and manuals. Other projects like Wikispecies, Wikinews, and Wikiversity cater to specific content niches such as taxonomy, news, and educational resources respectively. 

At www.wikimedia.org, visitors can access these diverse resources or contribute to their development. The platform operates on principles of open source and transparency, relying on public contributions and volunteer stewardship. The Wikimedia projects' ethos of open content ensures that knowledge is not only accessible but can also be freely shared, edited, and expanded, reflecting the Wikimedia Foundation's commitment to the democratization of knowledge.

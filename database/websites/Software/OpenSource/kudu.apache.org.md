## What is kudu.apache.org about?
Apache Kudu is an open-source data storage system developed under the Apache Software Foundation that is designed to enable efficient analytics on mutable and continuously changing datasets. Kudu bridges the gap between Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which excels at sequential data access, and Apache HBase, which is optimized for random access. It is specifically suitable for use cases such as time-series data, machine data analytics, and online reporting.

Kudu's architecture is designed for fast analytics on rapidly changing data, which includes support for strong consistency and the capability to handle high rates of data ingestion. It integrates seamlessly with other tools in the Hadoop ecosystem, such as Apache Spark, Apache Impala (incubating), and Apache Drill, allowing users to execute complex SQL queries, perform real-time analytics, and make data-intensive computations efficiently. The storage layer of Kudu is columnar and is optimized for analytic workloads, providing both efficient storage and high performance for sequential and random access patterns.

In essence, Kudu complements HDFS and HBase by providing a new storage option that is designed to support both high-performance sequential scans and efficient random access. Its support for real-time upserts and deletes enables use cases that were traditionally not well served by the Hadoop ecosystem, making it a valuable component for businesses that need to analyze data in motion.

## What is www.hospira.com about?
As of my knowledge cutoff date in April 2023, Hospira was a global pharmaceutical and medical device company that specialized in injectable drugs and infusion technologies. It was acquired by Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, in September 2015. The acquisition aimed to strengthen Pfizer's position in the global pharmaceutical market by integrating Hospira's portfolio of generic sterile injectables and biosimilars with Pfizer's global scale and resources.

Hospira was known for its commitment to providing high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to branded medications, including generic versions of critical care and oncology medicines. The company played a significant role in the production of biosimilars, which are biologic medical products that are highly similar to already approved reference products. Biosimilars offer a cost-effective option for patients and healthcare systems, and Hospira's expertise in this area complemented Pfizer's commitment to both innovation and patient access to life-saving treatments.

Pfizer's acquisition of Hospira helped expand its Global Established Products (GEP) portfolio. This merger brought together Hospira's extensive experience in developing complex generics with Pfizer's heritage in pioneering novel therapies, aiming to produce a comprehensive offering that meets a wide range of patient needs. With Hospira's products, Pfizer continued to sustain its presence in the injectable pharmaceuticals space and advance its position in the field of biosimilars, enhancing the availability of quality, affordable healthcare around the world.

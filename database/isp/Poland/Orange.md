# Orange Poland

Orange (AS5617) supports IPv6 in fixed broadband, but it requires manual opt-in. IPv6 service means dual-stack lite (IPv4 IPIP-tunneled over IPv6) unless nerdy trickery is at play to have real dual-stack (own hardware, two concurrent PPPoE sessions â€“ not supported by the ISP but works). Mobile service uses IPv6-only with 464XLAT translation. Both contract and prepaid.

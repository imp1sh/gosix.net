## What is www.peacocktv.com about?
Peacock TV is NBCUniversal's entry into the increasingly competitive streaming service landscape. Launched in July 2020, Peacock offers a unique blend of current season programming from NBC, news, sports, and a hefty library of films and television series. Unlike many streaming platforms, Peacock has a freemium model, with a base tier that is ad-supported and offers a partial catalog for no cost, and premium tiers that offer more content with limited or no ads for a monthly subscription fee.

The service was an immediate standout due to its large catalog from NBCUniversal's extensive content vault. Subscribers can enjoy classic shows from the NBC lineup, such as "The Office," "Parks and Recreation," and "Saturday Night Live." Peacock also features content across the broader NBCUniversal family, including shows from networks like USA, Bravo, Syfy, and Telemundo, along with Universal Pictures film titles. In addition, it has invested in original programming, with new series and reboots that have expanded its reach.

Moreover, Peacock serves as a hub for sports enthusiasts, offering live sports including the English Premier League, Olympic content, and WWE Network. Its news offering likewise integrates the depth of NBC's news operations, featuring live news and curated content. The diverse mix of free and premium content, alongside timely live offerings, positions Peacock TV as a significant player amidst the dynamic and ever-evolving streaming market.

## What is shardingsphere.apache.org about?
Apache ShardingSphere is an ecosystem of distributed database solutions developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It consists of a set of open-source tools and frameworks that enable developers to work with databases in a more efficient and scalable manner. The primary goal of ShardingSphere is to provide an overarching solution for data sharding, distributed transactions, and database orchestration, addressing the challenges faced when dealing with large-scale data systems.

At the core of Apache ShardingSphere are three independent products: ShardingSphere-JDBC, ShardingSphere-Proxy, and ShardingSphere-Sidecar. ShardingSphere-JDBC is a lightweight Java framework that provides data sharding capabilities at the application level, allowing developers to implement sharding within their applications without significant changes to the underlying database infrastructure. ShardingSphere-Proxy is a transparent database proxy layer that sits between the application and the database, enabling database sharding, scaling, and distributed transactions without touching the application code. ShardingSphere-Sidecar, drawing inspiration from the sidecar pattern in service mesh architecture, is designed for a cloud-native environment and focuses on providing a cloud-friendly data sharding solution.

By leveraging Apache ShardingSphere, businesses and enterprises can manage their data distribution across multiple databases and cloud services, ultimately enhancing the performance, scalability, and availability of their applications. Its plug-in-based architecture allows for flexible customization and extension based on specific project requirements, and being an open-source project, it benefits from the contributions and support of a large community of developers.

## What is www.apache.org about?
The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a non-profit organization that supports the Apache Software projects, which are collaborative, open-source software development endeavors. Among the most notable projects under its umbrella is the Apache HTTP Server, which has played a pivotal role in the expansion of the World Wide Web since its launch in the mid-1990s. Founded in 1999, the ASF has grown to steward over 350 open-source projects and initiatives brought to life by a diverse body of contributors from around the globe.

On the foundation's website, www.apache.org, you can find a vast array of resources including project documentation, software downloads, development tools, and community forums. The website is the central hub for all things Apache and serves as an entry point for developers looking to engage with or contribute to any Apache project. It provides governance policies that ensure fair and sustainable open-source development across all projects, an important aspect considering the breadth of the ASF's software repository, which spans databases, cloud computing, content management systems, big data tools, and more.

The ASF operates under a decentralized and collaborative approach, often referred to as "The Apache Way," which emphasizes inclusivity, consensus-based decision making, and pragmatic software licensing. This framework has proven to be successful in fostering innovation and maintaining high-quality software that serves millions of users worldwide. Through www.apache.org, the Foundation continues its mission to provide software for the public good, maintaining a commitment to open-source technology accessibility and longevity.

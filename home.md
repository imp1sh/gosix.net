# The IPv6 compatibility database


**Welcome to the **gosix.net** #IPv6 compatibility database.**
Here we blame those who fail at implementing IPv6 but we also document products with good IPv6 support.
gosix.net IPv6 compatibility database is a database that registers the IPv6 compatibility status for: bla

## :computer: Devices
This is about devices that have a network port or WiFi and don't run a classic computer OS but rather a firmware. 

## :keyboard: Software
The category of software is divided into client and server software. Both need IPv6 capabilities in order to support the current internet protocol.

## :space_invader: IOT
This is a lot like the devices category but those are generally smaller devices that serve in Home Automation or similar applications.

## :apple: Operating Systems
The landscape of Operating Systems is broader than you might think. There is not only Windows, macOS and Linux. This also covers the mobile devices OS market and even the more exotic OSes. Currently we are developing a robust test that will deliver you the best IPv6 compatibility data in the world.

## :joystick: Games
This is basically software, too but since it's a huge portion and also because there are games for consoles they get their own category. Video games today very often offer a multiplayer mode that is hosted on the developers servers. Those servers are often IPv4 only and this sometimes means that you won't be able to play them, because of lacking IPv6 support.

## :spider_web: Websites
You will be surprised how many of the biggest website do not speak IPv6. Here you can find an enormous list of websites that are or are not IPv6 compatible. The list is updated every 24h and you can influence on what websites shall be checked. Also we plan to implement a subscription service so you will be the first one to know, when github.com finally activates IPv6.

## :stop_button: Container Images
Container images are preconfigured applications. Depending on what the maintainer does, the container image may or may not support IPv6. gosix.net is the only resource that publishes information if your docker / podman container is IPv6 ready.

## :globe_with_meridians: Internet Service Provider (ISP)
Internet Service Providers sometimes fail big time on providing the clients with proper IPv6 connectivity. Yet ISP are one of the most important players in the IPv6 game. gosix.net's drive is to have the biggest and most recent list of providers that qualify for the next generation internet connectivity.

## :link: Datacenter providers
Datacenters usually have proper IPv6 connectivity for their customers but there are also black sheep. At gosix.net you will find a comprehensive list of datacenters that will deliver adequate IPv6 addresses for your servers, VMs and container hosts.

## :name_badge: Authoritative DNS Nameservers
Authoritative nameservers are the backbone of the internet. If DNS fails, the internet fails. Nameservers need to be reachable via IPv6 as well. Sadly that's not the case for all of them. gosix.net will shed light in the dark and give a nice list of DNS servers that are or are not IPv6 ready.

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Authorities
We plan to have a list of which authorities are IPv6 ready. While the Czeck Republic announed to end IPv4 support in 2032, others have not even heard yet of IPv6.

## Rankings

There is a ranking of how good the IPv6 compatibility is

| Name | Tag | Symbol | Symbol Code | Description |  
| - | - | - | - | - | 
| perfect | rank1 | :1st_place_medal: | `:1st_place_medal:` | there is nothing to complain about, at all |
| very good | rank2 | :2nd_place_medal: | `:2nd_place_medal:` | it's mostly perfect but there are few but mostly not very important flaws |
| not bad | rank3 | :3rd_place_medal: | `:3rd_place_medal:` | IPv6 support is good but there are few annoying flaws or some more not very important flaws |
| flawed | rank4 | :arrow_down: | `:arrow_down:` | IPv6 support is somewhat there but there are too many flaws to make good use of it.
| problematic | rank5 | :arrow_double_down: | `:arrow_double_down:` | IPv6 support is very incomplete, major flaws
| nonexistent | rank6 | :x: | `:x:` | There is no IPv6 support at all |
| totalfailure | totalfailure | :wastebasket: | `:wastebasket:` | This is a special award for companies that have no interest in the foreseeable future to support IPv6 |
